// Clang UPC Front-End

// Clang UPC extends the Clang/LLVM C Language Family Front-end

Welcome to Clang UPC.  This is a compiler front-end for the C family
of languages (C, UPC, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++) which
is built as part of the LLVM compiler infrastructure project.

Unlike many other compiler frontends, Clang UPC is useful for a number of things
beyond just compiling code: we intend for Clang UPC to be host to a number of
different source-level tools.  One example of this is the Clang Static Analyzer.
